# QR Instructions — Exit-Only Compliance

## 📱 Rules
- **Scan only on exit** — after all work in the zone is fully complete.  
- **Don’t scan on arrival** — scans confirm **completion**, not entry.  
- **Every assignment requires a scan** — missed scans are treated as a missed zone.

## 📝 Notes (Use Every Time Something’s Off)
- Log supply shortages, damage, hazards, or layout problems in **Notes**.  
- Notes generate **real-time action items** for Managers and Leads.

## 🔒 Accountability
- Each scan certifies the zone is ready.  
- Missed scans may trigger compliance checks/audits.

## ✅ Best Practices
- Scan after the last task before you leave the zone.  
- Always add Notes for context (e.g., “chair broken,” “marker out,” “spill triangulated”).  
- Urgent hazards: log in Notes **and** notify a Manager/Lead verbally.
