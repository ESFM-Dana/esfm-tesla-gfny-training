# End of Shift — Frontline

Complete these tasks **before** clock-out.

## 1) Equipment & Cart
- Return carts to assigned storage (e.g., Mechanical Room B).
- Remove all used rags and flat mop heads → dirty laundry bin.
- Wipe cart handles/surfaces; no residue, no trash left on carts.
- Plug in any battery equipment.

## 2) Zone Closeout
- Remove trash; replace liners; wipe rims if dirty.
- Floors: leave safe and dry (post wet floor signs while mopping).
- Restock dispensers (soap, paper towels, toilet paper) to par levels.
- Log final **QR scan** where posted; add brief notes if anything is off.

## 3) Report Issues
- Damage, missing stock, leaks, or hazards → notify lead/manager.
- If a restroom or café wasn't stocked on arrival, include it in your notes.

✅ When finished, tell your lead/manager you’re complete and ready for release.
