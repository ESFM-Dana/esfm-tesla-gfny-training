# Shift Leads — Route Ownership & Coaching

## Mission
Keep the floor moving: right person, right zone, right frequency — safely.

## Checklist
- Verify carts stocked and **wet floor** signage available.
- Assign routes and backup coverage for breaks/lunches.
- Confirm **QR scans** at start/end of services where posted.
- Audit presentation: restrooms, cafés, lobbies — fix issues on the spot.
- Note wins and misses; report patterns to the manager.

## Route Supervision
- Restrooms: verify cycles match shift expectations (see Route Cards).
- Cafés/Kitchenettes: extra passes during break windows.
- Lobbies/Entrances: glass + floors; keep it “client ready” all day.

## Coaching
- Demonstrate correct mopping sequence, touchpoint sanitizing, and restocking.
- Pair new hires with a high performer for the first week.

## Quick Escalations
- Safety hazard, equipment failure, or repeated neglect → notify manager.
