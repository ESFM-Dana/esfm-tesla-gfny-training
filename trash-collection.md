# Trash Collection — Interior & Exterior Standards

## Core Expectations
- Patrol on a defined route; prevent overflow (service **before** 3/4 full).
- Replace liners on every pull; wipe rims and lids if dirty.
- Segregate recyclables when applicable (follow posted signage).
- Keep bagged waste tied and contained; no leaks on floors.

## Interior — Step-by-Step
1. **Approach & assess**: Bin fill level, contamination (liquids, sharp objects).
2. **Remove & tie**: Pull liner, tie securely; double-bag if puncture risk.
3. **Wipe contact points**: Rim/lid and surrounding surfaces if soiled.
4. **Replace liner**: Correct size; tuck edges neatly.
5. **Transport**: Use cart; lids closed. Keep bags off the floor where possible.
6. **Spill response**: If a leak occurs, **stop**, set a wet floor sign, spot‑mop, then continue.

## Exterior — Grounds & Entryways
- Empty exterior cans and replace liners.
- Police grounds for litter: entries, smoking areas, docks, walkways, curbs, islands.
- Use grabbers for debris; do not reach blindly into bushes or containers.
- Flatten cardboard; take to designated recycling/staging.
- Report large debris, hazards, or illegal dumping to Security/Facilities.

## Compactor / Dumpster (if applicable)
- Secure cart wheels before tipping; maintain three points of contact.
- Keep gates latched; never climb on compacted waste.
- No loose liquids into compactors; follow battery/e‑waste/sharps procedures.

## Safety & PPE
- Required: gloves; add cut‑resistant gloves for glass/metal edges.
- **Sharps**: Never compress by hand. Use tongs; place in sharps container and notify manager.
- Chemical containers: Cap and segregate; follow SDS guidance.

## Accountability / QR (where enabled)
- Log QR scans at start/end of route where posted.
- Note contamination or recurring overflow in the shift report with location and time.

**Tip**: Busy windows (breaks/lunch) need extra passes. Adjust patrol frequency to prevent overflow.
