# Janitor’s Closet — End-of-Shift Standards

- Return all carts to **Mechanical Room B** (or assigned storage).
- Remove **all** used rags & flat mop heads → dirty laundry bin.
- Restock to par: liners, paper, soaps, and chemicals (labels facing out).
- Plug in battery equipment; verify charger lights indicate charging.
- Account for caution/wet floor signs and spill kit completeness.
- Wipe cart surfaces/handles; no residue, no stray trash.
- Report broken/missing items to the manager **before** clock-out.

> If something’s off, take a quick photo and attach it to your shift log.
