# Managers — EVS Playbook

## Core Responsibilities
- Own shift outcomes: safety, compliance, service quality, and client satisfaction.
- Ensure **QR scan** coverage meets expectations by area type (restrooms, cafés, lobbies).
- Run the **Incoming/Outgoing Manager** handoff process and resolve discrepancies.
- Coach, document, and escalate per policy; recognize wins and top performers.

## Daily Rhythm
- **Pre-shift**: Attendance, zone assignments, cart/closet checks, safety brief.
- **Mid-shift**: Route verifications, restroom spot checks, café/lobby presentation check.
- **End-of-shift**: Handoff report submitted; confirm equipment plugged/stocked; incidents logged.

## Handoff & Accountability
- Outgoing → send concise status + issues; Incoming → confirm truthfulness and gaps.
- If data conflicts, document discrepancies and corrective actions.
- Use photos for repeated or serious issues.

## KPIs (examples)
- Zone compliance (% expected zones hit by shift)
- Overdue zones (2+ hours without scan where applicable)
- Repeat misses by zone/employee
- Stock-on-arrival failures (restrooms/cafés)
- Safety incidents & response time

## Communication
- Keep Security in the loop for hazards or evacuations.
- Share quick wins to maintain morale; follow escalation chain for chronic issues.

## Safety
- Enforce PPE, chemical handling, ladder use, and wet-floor signage.
- During alarms: account for staff at Muster Point 4; report headcount up-chain.
