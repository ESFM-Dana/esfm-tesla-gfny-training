# Project Workers — Training

This guide sets the standard for **deep cleans, periodic work, event resets, and one-off tasks**. Follow it exactly unless your manager specifies a different approved method.

---

## 1) Scope & Role
**You are assigned to project work** (not routine rounds). Typical tasks include: restroom deep cleans (Kaivac), top scrub & recoat, high dusting/detail, spill extraction, event setup/reset, exterior detail, and office moves.

**Your goals:** safe execution, clean results, zero damage, minimal disruption to operations, and complete documentation.

---

## 2) Minimum Standards & Conduct
- Arrive in clean uniform and required **PPE** (see below).
- No shortcuts, no unsafe practices, no unattended hazards.
- Keep work areas neat; manage cords/hoses to avoid trip hazards.
- Communicate clearly with your **shift lead/manager**; report obstacles early.

---

## 3) PPE & Safety
- **Required**: gloves; add cut-resistant gloves for sharp edges/glass.
- **When using machines/chemicals**: eye protection, closed-toe slip-resistant shoes.
- **Noise**: hearing protection when specified.
- Post **wet floor/caution signage** **before** water or chemicals hit the floor.
- Respect barricades; never block fire exits or egress routes.
- Follow **SDS** and dilution requirements for all chemicals.
- **Stop Work Authority**: If it feels unsafe or unclear, **stop** and call the lead/manager.

---

## 4) Pre-Job Brief (Tailboard)
Before starting, cover these with your lead/manager:
- **Location(s)** and boundaries of work
- **Task steps**, chemicals, dilution, and equipment
- **PPE** and barricade plan (cones, tape, signs)
- **Traffic / coordination** (break windows, production aisles, escorts if required)
- **Waste handling** (dumpster/compactor rules, recyclables, sharps)
- **Success criteria** (what “done” looks like)
- **Photos**: before / after
- **Who signs off** (lead or manager)

> Log a quick note on the shift report or project ticket stating that the tailboard occurred.

---

## 5) Equipment & Materials
- Check equipment condition **before** use (pads/brushes, squeegee, cords, filters).
- Verify chargers and batteries are good; stage **backup liners/pads** as needed.
- Use the **correct pad and dilution** for the floor type and soil load.
- Keep a **spill kit** and **wet floor signs** within reach.

---

## 6) Barricades & Floor Protection
- Establish a safe work zone (cones + tape + signs) before starting.
- Protect adjacent floors, thresholds, and sensitive finishes (e.g., mats, plastic, absorbent socks).
- Keep walk paths open where possible, or provide attendants at pinch points.

---

## 7) Standard Project SOPs

### A) Restroom Deep Clean — Kaivac / Detail
1. **Set** barricades; remove trash/loose debris.
2. **Pre-spray** fixtures, floors, walls/partitions per chemical SDS; allow dwell time.
3. **Agitate** high soil areas (brush/pad); detail hinges, bases, grout lines.
4. **Rinse/extract** with Kaivac (or wet vac) from back to front.
5. **Polish** metal and mirrors; **restock** all dispensers.
6. **Final mop** or squeegee to finish; remove odors.
7. **QA check** (see checklist); **photos**; **sign-off**.

### B) Top Scrub & Recoat (No full strip)
1. **Dust mop** and spot scrape gum/adhesive.
2. **Apply** top-scrub solution; **agitate** with scrub machine and appropriate pad.
3. **Wet vac** and rinse until neutral; allow to dry.
4. **Apply finish** in thin, even coats (2–3 as specified). Allow full dry between coats.
5. **Detail edges**; remove any finish from baseboards immediately.
6. **QA** for uniform gloss and no swirl marks; **photos**; **sign-off**.

### C) High Dusting & Detail
1. **Barricade/fall-risk** areas; use proper ladder safety and spotters if needed.
2. **Work high-to-low**; dislodge dust onto tarps where possible.
3. **Wipe/HEPA vac** touch surfaces and nearby ledges.
4. **QA** for missed lines/shadows; **photos**; **sign-off**.

### D) Spill Extraction (Carpet/Mat)
1. **Set** signs/barricades; identify liquid type.
2. **Blot/extract** from outside-in; avoid overwetting.
3. **Rinse/neutralize** per SDS; lift pile and accelerate dry (air movers).
4. **QA** for wicking/staining; schedule a re-check if needed; **photos**.

### E) Event Setup/Reset / Office Move
1. **Confirm scope** and room diagram; protect floors/walls.
2. **Move** items safely (team lift; carts with intact wheels; no dragging).
3. **Reset** per diagram; remove all tape, debris, and tools.
4. **QA** with requestor/lead; **photos**; **sign-off**.

## 8) During-Job Quality Gates
- Stop at **25% / 50% / 90%** to inspect critical details (edges, corners, thresholds, finishes).
- Correct errors immediately (don’t leave “polish later” tasks).
- Keep walk paths clear; maintain signage and barricades as work zones shift.

---

## 9) Completion — QA Checklist & Sign-Off
- ☐ Area clean and dry; no residue, haze, or chemical odor
- ☐ Floors uniform (no swirl marks, no puddles, no missed edges)
- ☐ Fixtures/glass metal polished where applicable
- ☐ Barricades removed; walk path safe; signs removed last
- ☐ Waste disposed correctly (no liquids in compactor; recyclables separated)
- ☐ **Before/After photos** captured and attached to shift report/ticket
- ☐ Tools cleaned; tanks emptied; pads/brushes rinsed and stored
- ☐ Chargers connected; closet staged for next shift
- ☐ **Lead/Manager sign-off** recorded

---

## 10) Documentation & Accountability
- Attach **before/after photos** to the shift report or project ticket.
- Note chemicals used, dilution, pad type, and any issues encountered.
- If the task area has a **QR** code, scan at start/end with a short note “Project – <task>”.

---

## 11) Waste Handling
- Tie bags securely; **double-bag** if puncture risk.
- No loose liquids into compactors; follow **battery/e-waste/sharps** procedures.
- Report hazards or unusual waste to **Security/Facilities** and your manager.

---

## 12) Post-Job Debrief
- 3-minute huddle with lead/manager: what worked, what to improve, supply needs, next steps.
- Record **lessons learned** in the project log to improve the next run.
