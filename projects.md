# Project Work — Planning & QA

## What counts as a project?
Deep cleans, periodic tasks (e.g., Kaivac cycles), event support, move-ins/outs, one-off factory tasks.

## Planning Template
- **Title**: 
- **Date/Time Window**: 
- **Location/Zone(s)**: 
- **Scope**: steps, chemicals, equipment
- **Crew**: names/roles
- **Safety**: PPE, barricades/signage, special permits
- **Success Criteria**: what “done” looks like
- **Photos**: before/after

## Execution & QA
- Post a caution perimeter; keep lanes clear.
- Verify results against **Success Criteria**; manager/lead signs off.
- Log completion in shift report; attach photos and follow-ups (if any).

## Scheduling
- Coordinate with managers to avoid break/lunch peaks and production surges.
- For factory work, secure access approvals ahead of time.
