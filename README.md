# ESFM Tesla GFNY — Training Docs

This repository powers a public GitHub Pages site with standardized frontline training for the Tesla GFNY account.

## Quick start
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (public is simplest for frontline access).
2. Upload these files (or push via git).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Build and deployment** to **GitHub Pages** and **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**. Select the **main** branch and **/(root)** folder.
4. Wait ~1 minute. Your site will be live at `https://<your-org>.github.io/<your-repo>/`.

### Editing
- Update Markdown files (`.md`) to change content.
- Use pull requests for approvals if you want controlled edits.
- Add PDFs/images under `assets/` and link to them from pages.

Powered by the **just-the-docs** theme.
