# Emergency Evacuation — EVS Playbook (All Shifts)

## When the alarm/alert triggers
- Stop work. Leave carts/equipment where they are (do not retrieve gear).
- Use the closest safe exit; do not use elevators.
- Assist nearby people if they need help getting out.

## After you’re outside
- Text your manager: `OUT SAFE — <Your Name> — <Zone/Area>`
- Go directly to **Muster Point 4** and wait for headcount.
- Stay with your team; do not re-enter until the official all‑clear.

## Manager headcount flow
1. Roll call: mark **Present / Missing / With Security or Medical**.
2. Report headcount status up the chain (per shift protocol).
3. Keep staff in place until released or reassigned.

## Re-entry & recovery
- Re-enter **only** on instruction from Security/Management.
- Check your area for hazards (wet floors, toppled gear, chemical leaks).
- Resume services. Log any damage/spills in the shift report.

**Notes**
- Drills follow the same flow. Treat every activation as real until told otherwise.
- If Muster Point 4 is inaccessible, follow Security’s direction to an alternate point.
