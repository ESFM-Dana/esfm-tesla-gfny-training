# How to Contribute / Update Content

## Edit Workflow (Simple)
1. Click **Edit this page** on GitHub (pencil icon) â†’ propose changes.
2. Submit a **Pull Request** for manager review.
3. When merged to `main`, the site updates automatically.

## Style & Structure
- Keep it task-first. Lead with checklists and visuals.
- Use short sentences and bullets; avoid walls of text.
- Include photos or quick diagrams where clarity helps (`assets/` folder).

## File Naming & Organization
- One page per zone type: `restrooms.md`, `cafes.md`, `lobbies.md`, etc.
- Put images/PDFs in `assets/` and link using relative paths.

## Versioning
- Use PR titles like: `feat(restrooms): add deep-clean Kaivac steps` or `docs(cafes): update floor care SOP`.
- Include why the change matters in the PR description.

## Governance
- Shift managers are code owners for their sections.
- Anything safety-related requires director approval.
