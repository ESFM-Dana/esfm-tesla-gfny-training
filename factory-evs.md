# Factory EVS — Scope & Standards

> Placeholder for full factory scope. Use this page to capture standards as zones come online.

## Initial Focus
- Define factory service zones and frequencies (restrooms, production aisles, mezzanines, docks).
- Identify PPE and hazard controls per area (traffic lanes, forklifts, chemicals, lock-out points).
- Align with Security and Production on access windows and escorts (where required).

## Standards (Draft)
- Restrooms/Locker Rooms: follow restroom checklist with added shower protocols.
- Production Aisles/Hallways: debris removal, dust control, and spill response.
- Docks/Receiving: litter patrol, pallet wrap removal, and slip hazard checks.

## Safety
- High-visibility vests, hearing protection, and additional PPE as signed.
- Never cross live production lines without authorization.
- Report near-misses and unsafe conditions immediately.

## Accountability
- Add QR points as zones go live; log routes and exceptions in shift reports.
