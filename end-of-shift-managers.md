## Handoff & Documentation
- Submit **Outgoing Manager** handoff (status, issues, photos/links as needed).
- Trigger **Incoming Manager** handoff email with link to their form.
- Review/attach key discrepancies (stock-on-arrival failures, missed zones, repeat issues).

## Equipment & Closets
- Verify carts parked correctly; chargers active; spill kits complete.
- Confirm dirty laundry collected and sent per schedule.
- Note any broken equipment or supply shortages; open tickets if needed.

## Compliance Snapshot
- Spot-check QR scan coverage vs. expectations for restrooms/cafés/lobbies.
- Record overdue zones or misses that require follow-up next shift.
- Capture any safety incidents and responses.

## Communications
- Send summary to shift distro (manager/leads + director as required).
- Escalate recurring gaps; record wins and shout-outs.

> Managers should maintain a running list of follow-ups for the next shift and include quick context in the Outgoing report.
