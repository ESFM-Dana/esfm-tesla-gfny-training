## ⚠️ Important Notes
This is a high-visibility area. Every detail matters.
Clean as you go — don’t wait until next round to fix footprints, trash, or smudges.
Report any damage, spills, or hazards to your Supervisor immediately.

## 📱 QR Process (Exit-Only Compliance)
Scan on Exit Only (Completion Rule):
Scan the QR code only after zone work is fully completed and you are leaving.
Do not scan on entry.
Each Assignment Requires a Scan:
Every time you complete duties and exit the zone, scan.
Missed scans = missed zone in EVS X-Ray.
Use Notes for Issues:
Supply shortages, damages, graffiti, safety hazards.
Example: “Vestibule glass cracked,” “Mat saturated,” “Goose droppings at bus shelter.”
Automatic Alerts:
Notes generate real-time alerts to Managers and Leads.
Urgent Issues Protocol:
Hazards (broken glass, slip risks, security concerns) must be logged in QR Notes and verbally escalated to a Manager/Lead immediately.

## 🎯 Standards of Success
Glass = smudge-free and streak-free.
Floors & mats = aligned, clean, and dry.
Entrances = clear of debris, safe, and professional.
Counters, desks, and stations = dust-free and organized.
Every visit ends with a QR exit scan.
